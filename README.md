I made an iPhone designed calculator, I hope you like it.

All features work smoothly.

I kept a history on the left with all your transactions and their results. You can keep your data and transactions by connecting it to localstorage.

I added a Delete All button in the middle of the page. You can delete all transactions in localstorage and there is an "x" icon to the right of the transactions. You can clear the transaction you want with 2 different methods.
